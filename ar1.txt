Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines that can simulate human intelligence, allowing them to learn, reason, make decisions, and perform tasks like language understanding and image recognition. AI systems process data to identify patterns, learn from experience, and improve their performance over time without direct human programming. Widely used in various industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation, AI powers applications from virtual assistants and self-driving cars to personalized recommendations and complex data analysis.
